# **Next.js Assessment – Schema-Driven Multi-Step Form Renderer**

A modern, customizable **multi-step form renderer** built with **Next.js**, **React Hook Form**, and **TypeScript**.
This project shows how to generate dynamic, validated forms entirely from a JSON schema—supporting conditional fields, nested groups, animations, and a polished UI.
